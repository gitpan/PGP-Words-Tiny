NAME
    PGP::Words::Tiny - Convert data to/from the PGP word list

VERSION
    version 0.002

SYNOPSIS
      use PGP::Words::Tiny qw/encode_pgp_hex decode_pgp_hex/;

      say join " ", encode_pgp_hex("0xe582"); # "topmost Istanbul"

      say decode_pgp_hex("topmost Istanbul"); # "0xe582"

DESCRIPTION
    This module converts octets to or from the PGP word list
    <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PGP_word_list>, allowing a byte sequence
    to be conveyed via easily readable words.

    It is similar in function to Crypt::OpenPGP::Words, but without
    requiring all of Crypt::OpenPGP. This module also provides decoding
    functions.

USAGE
    The following functions are available for import. None are imported by
    default.

  encode_pgp
      @words = encode_pgp( $octets );

    Returns a list of words drawn from the PGP word list corresponding to
    each octet in the input string. Even-position octets (starting at octet
    zero) are drawn from the even word list. Odd-position octets are drawn
    from the odd word list.

    Proper nouns are capitalized as per the official word list.

  encode_pgp_hex
      @words = encode_pgp_hex( $hex_string );

    Converts a string of hex digits (with or without leading "0x") to an
    octet string and returns the result of passing that octet string to
    "encode_pgp".

  decode_pgp
      $octets = decode_pgp( @words );  # qw/topmost Istanbul/
      $octets = decode_pgp( $string ); # qq/topmost Istanbul/

    Returns a string of octets decoded from a list of PGP words or from a
    space-separated string of PGP words. An exception is thrown if a word is
    not in the PGP word list or is not in the correct even/odd position.

    Input words are not case sensitive.

  decode_pgp_hex
      $hex_string = decode_pgp_hex( @words );
      $hex_string = decode_pgp_hex( $string );

    Returns a string of lowercase hex digits (preceded by "0x") decoded from
    a list of PGP words. It otherwise functions like "decode_pgp".
